- 👋 Hi, I’m @NikhSethM
- 👀 I’m interested in social entrepreneurial projects
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to better market my current social project in Geneva. We are a social caterer and we empower migrant women by giving them the opportunity to share their culture through their home made meals from their country of origin, and earn an income by doing that.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating a system to optimize our catering process to facilitate the order process for corporate clients while keeping the chefs motivated
- 📫 How to reach me is by email : nikhil@niksfudo.ch or : Nikhil.masilamani@gmail.com
